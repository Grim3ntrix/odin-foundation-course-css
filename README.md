# Intro to CSS

## Introduction

In the last lesson, we looked at how HTML is used to structure a web page. The next step is all about making that structure look good, which is what CSS is for. Over the next few lessons, we’ll be focusing on some foundational CSS concepts—stuff that everyone should know, whether you’re new to it or just need a quick refresher.
